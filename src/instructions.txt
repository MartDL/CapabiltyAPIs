 1. Create application using Create-react-app 
 2. In your src folder add a 'utils' folder.
 3. In the 'utils' folder add the qlikApp connecting file (see attached)
 4. Now we have this file we need to build a config object and make the qlik app/object ready to use. 
    First, we add a 'context' folder and adding a QlikContext file.
 5. For this we use 'useContext' to pass the data to the neccessary files
 6. In your index.js file, import your QlikProvider function and wrap your App in in your useContext provider.

 7. Create a React component, This one is called Page.
 8. import the qlik Object from the QlikContext that was made before
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Now we have a Page component we can now build our webpage and display charts and data from qlik.
 I would now console.log(app) to make sure you are connected and your empty object is ready to use.

 9.Get the Object from app using getObject() - this takes 2 params. First, asign your object and ID, and Second, get it using  the actual ObjectId from Qlik.
 10.Render this in a div tag by using the ID you chose. **You must also give the object a height and width**
 11.Add the Selection bar from qlik to your web page by adding one line of code
 12.If you want to go one step further you can custom this chart by using the Visualization API
